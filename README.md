# CTC_AUTOMATION
We are initializing a project for automating massive manual work at CTC

## Step 1: name a list of tasks you think you want to automate.
**Yong**
- Selling Curve: I am in the process of creating a bot (90% work done)
- Some comments from Christy.
  - Make the code more flexible to accept user input
  - The selling cycle does not matter in the SQL query, its main purpose is for curve name convention
  - Sometimes different years have more than 52 weeks, you need to consider that as well
  - Looking at the selling curve at the style level can make the prediction better
  - use machine learning to group similar styles together so that the same selling curve can be applied to them
  - only build the selling curve for the styles that has the exact start week.
