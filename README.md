# CTC_AUTOMATION
We are initializing a project for automating massive manual work at CTC

## Step 1: name a list of tasks you think you want to automate.
**Yong** 
- Selling Curve: I am in the process of creating a bot (90% work done)
- Some comments from Christy.
  - Make the code more flexible to accept user input
  - The selling cycle does not matter in the SQL query, its main purpose is for curve name convention
  - Sometimes different years have more than 52 weeks, you need to consider that as well
  - Looking at the selling curve at the style level can make the prediction better
  - use machine learning to group similar styles together so that the same selling curve can be applied to them
  - only build the selling curve for the styles that has the exact start week.
  - Question 1: what is dmdunit and why it has to start with C_

**Adam**:
- (July 7 2022): Heres my notebook file for the recship updates. I noticed a small part of the code doesnt work on the anaconda I personally downloaded because I originally built it on the company anaconda which has an old version of pandas. It might not work for you but I'm pretty sure its an easy fix, it just has something to do with the fillna code.
